# OAuth2 Authentication with Spring Boot ðŸš€
Hey there! Welcome to our OAuth2 authentication project built with Spring Boot. This readme will get you up to speed on what this project does and how you can use it.

## What's This All About?
So, this project is basically a cool demo showing how we handle user authentication using OAuth2 and JWT tokens in a Spring Boot app. You know, stuff like registering users, logging them in, and generating those snazzy tokens.

## How to Get Started
Prerequisites 
Before you dive in, make sure you have the following installed:

## Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
Apache Maven
MongoDB or another supported database (you'll need to configure this in application.properties)
Postman or some other tool for testing APIs
## Installation
Clone the Repository: Get yourself a copy of this project by running:

bash ``
  git clone https://github.com/example/oAuth.git
Go to the Project Directory: Jump into the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd oAuth
Build the Project: Fire up Maven to build the project:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the App: Start the Spring Boot magic:

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
## How to Use It
Once the app is up and running, you can start playing around with it using some HTTP requests. Here's a quick rundown of the available endpoints:

POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user. Just send over a JSON with userName and password, and you'll get a JWT token in return!

POST /api/auth/login: Log in an existing user. Again, a JSON with userName and password will do the trick. You'll get a shiny new JWT token as a reward for logging in successfully.

POST /api/auth/token: Need to refresh your JWT token? No problemo! Send the old token as refreshToken in a JSON payload, and voilÃ ! You'll get a fresh one in return.
